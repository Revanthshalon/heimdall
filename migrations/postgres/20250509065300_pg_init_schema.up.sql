/*
 * TABLE: heimdall_relation_tuples
 *
 * PURPOSE:
 *   Core table implementing Google's Zanzibar authorization system, storing relationship tuples
 *   that define who has what permissions on which resources.
 *
 * FEATURES:
 *   - Fine-grained permission control with tuple-based access modeling
 *   - Supports both direct user permissions and group-based (subject set) permissions
 *   - Horizontal scaling via sharding for high-volume authorization systems
 *   - Multi-tenant architecture with complete network isolation
 *   - Optimized for fast permission lookups and traversals
 *
 * USAGE:
 *   - Direct permission check: "Can user X perform relation Y on object Z?"
 *   - Group membership checks: "Is user X a member of group G with relation R?"
 *   - Permission graph traversal for complex authorization decisions
 *   - Used for both read-time permission checks and write-time validation
